Well
It goes like this
You find out you have similar interests
You use your finite sense of humor to entertain her
But you're always wondering what she'll infer
Oh, such complex human nature
Oh, she's the best
You keep on sending her these hilarious image texts
Always on the hunt for what you should send next
Second-guessing, and perplexed
Guess her attention's got you vexed
Worried you'll soon, run out of jеst
But don't worry about it
We're just as cluelеss as the rest
We're all just looking to connect
With no idea of what happens next
Probably alone with nothing left
You love the way she makes you feel
You start to synchronize your meals
You compromise, you make some deals
Swapped excitement for some comfort
Back where you started
It's just the same old song and dance
A safety net or a love trance
You make them witness promises
Bound by jewels, your happiness
Your love's just not like how it was
Living with these mini-monuments of your love
Blessings from up above
But her focus is not on you
And the love escapes you too
But don't worry about it
We're just as clueless as the rest
We're all just looking to connect
With no idea of what happens next
When you're alone, time to reflect
