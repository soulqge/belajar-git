Anything You Want

Trails of smoke trapped in a two by two
Wasting the night feels right when I'm with you
It's the shimmer in your eyes
And the way you let down your disguise
I feel like I've known you for ages
I feel like with you I'm going places
Ahh, ahh
The same song on repeat
"You can call me anything you want"
It's fine by me
Number two out of three
He says that it's his favorite
And I can't disagree
